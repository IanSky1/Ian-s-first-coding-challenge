# Ian-s-first-coding-challenge

For this code refactor challenge, I cloned the initial starter code that was provided and made many changes to both the html file and the CSS style sheet.
First in the html file, I replaced all of the div elements with Semantic elements. I then created alt attributes for all of the images. Lastly I added comments for every section of the html code.

For the CSS style sheet, I first added comments for all of the sections then rearranged the CSS rules to match the order of the elements in the html file.
